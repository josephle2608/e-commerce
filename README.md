# Shopping is Fun
Building an online shopping site is an interestring project that I like to work on. Building the website helped me to learn more about many techniques that are used in React and JavaScript. They are interesting and I find it's fun to have the project in my Github portfolio.  
This is the website. Hope you enjoy it!
